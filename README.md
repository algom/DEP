## DEP package

### Overview of the analysis

This analysis workflow provides an integrated solution for robust and reproducible differential analysis (protein expression or protein enrichment) of proteomics data. 
It requires tabular input (e.g. txt files) which are generated by quantitative analysis softwares of raw mass spectrometry data, such as [MaxQuant](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n12/full/nbt.1511.html) or [IsobarQuant](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v10/n10/full/nprot.2015.101.html).   
Functions are provided for data preparation, data filtering, variance normalization and imputation of missing values, as well as statistical testing of differential enriched/expressed proteins.
It also includes tools to check intermediate steps within the workflow, such as normalization and missing values imputation.
Finally, visualization tools are provided to explore the results, including heatmap, volcano plot and barplot representations.   
Besides differential analysis, the package includes a set of functions to calculate relative stoichiometry, as originally desribed in [Smits et al (2013)](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/1/e28.full).   
For scientists with limited experience in R, the package also entails wrapper functions that entail the complete analysis workflow and generate a report (see the chapter on [Wrapper functions](#wrapper-functions-for-the-entire-workflow)).
Even easier to use are the interactive Shiny apps that are provided by the package (see the chapter on [Shiny apps](#interactive-analysis-using-the-proteomer-shiny-apps)).
